# HangMan
I created the classic game HangMan and added some additional features. 
I used C++, OOP and the <graphics.h> library, and worked in Microsoft Visual Studio and Codeblocks.

The additional features are:

✖ Menu

✖ 1 player or 2 players mode
1 player mode has the option of choosing the language you want the word to be in (I used English and Romanian)
In 1 player mode, the computer will generate a random word for you (chosen from a .txt with 150 words that can be edited at any time)
In 2 players mode, Player 1 will type a word that will disappear and Player 2 will have to guess it.

✖ Wizards and Fairies
When the player has less than 4 lives left, there will be a chance that a wizard or a fairy will appear on the screen.
When a wizard appears, he will give the player another life.
When a fairy appears, she will suggest using a letter that it's sure to be found in the word that the player tries to guess.

✖ Play Again option
